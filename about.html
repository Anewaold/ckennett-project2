        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>Sleepyhead is the product of singer/songwriter & producer Casey Kennett. Coming from the North suburbs of Chicago, Kennett started releasing music in high school under the name ‘Kolla’, with his best friend, Julian Paez. Kolla amassed over 400,000 streams on Spotify. Now in New Orleans, Kennett uses Sleepyhead as a melting pot of genres combining the sonic space of late 2000s alternative synth pop, modern drum grooves of current dance music, and introspective lyrics carrying themes of the importance of the current moment. Sleepyhead has 5 songs out on all platforms, as well as a feature on Louis The Child’s Beat tape that came out in December of 2022, ‘Black Marble’. Taking inspiration from genre pushers such as Jai Paul, Flume, and MGMT, Sleepyhead's music will always have a signature sound that is colorful, rich, and vibrant.
